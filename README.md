# WriteAndRelease

A minimalist writing tool to declutter your mind. Write 250 words, let it go, feel lighter. No saving, no editing—just release.

Inspired by the morning pages concept, the goal is to get your thoughts out on the page without overthinking, editing, or formatting. 

## How It Works
- **Start Typing**: Open the page, type whatever’s in your head.

- **30-Second Timer**: Stop for 30 seconds before 250 words? It wipes. Keeps you moving.

- **250-Word Goal**: Hit 250, the timer stops, and a “Release” button appears.

- **Let It Go**: Click “Release” to erase it. Every visit’s a fresh page—no history, no clutter.

## Why WriteAndRelease?

Mental clutter sucks. This is a quick, no-pressure way to dump your thoughts and reset. It’s not a journal or a note app—it’s a mind flush.
It encourages a daily writing habit, helping you gain mental clarity, reduce mental clutter, and practice mindfulness through free, uninterrupted writing.
